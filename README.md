# Deep-Brain-Simulation-for-Alzheimer-s-patient
In this project I motivated by a hypothesis by a research team from University of Toronto that a particular area of the human brain named 'Fornix' is responsible for increasing memory in the brain and this may be a potential clinical cure for affected brain cell like Alzheimer's patient. Alzheimer's patient suffer from declination of memory. Alzheimer's disease can be clinically healed(not fully-cured though) by applying Deep Brain Stimulation for the patients are in early Alzheimer's disease. My quest to find various features and factors and give accurate prediction by building various Machine Learning model and Artificial Neural Network to detect early Alzheimer's patient, hence, help them to undergo Deep Brain Simulation(DBS) process for Alzheimer's treatment.
